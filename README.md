# demo-spark-sensor-data-integrator-css-wrapper
See [big-data-europe/demo-integrator-ui](https://github.com/big-data-europe/demo-integrator-ui) for more information on the general construction of this image.

This specific image is built so it can forward requests for [big-data-europe/demo-spark-sensor-data](https://github.com/big-data-europe/demo-spark-sensor-data)

The result of this is a Docker container which proxies the requests to the offered integrated interfaces, now with custom CSS injected.
